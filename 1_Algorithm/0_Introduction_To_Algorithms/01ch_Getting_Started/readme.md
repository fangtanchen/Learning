## Getting Started
- Having specified the algorithm, 
- we then argue that it correctly sorts and we analyze its running time

## Insertion Sort
- Sorting Problem
    - Input: a sequence of n numbers
    - Output: A permutation (reordering) of the input sequence 
- Loop Invariations
- Steps:
    1. Initialization
    1. Maintenance
    1. Termination

- pseudocode
    - whatever expressive method is most clear and concise to specify
    - not concerned with issues of software engineering
