Deep Canonical Correlation Analysis, a method to learn complex nonlinear transformations of two views of data such taht the resulting representations are highly linearly correlated.

KCCA kernal canonical correlated nonlinear analysis.

non-saturating sigmoid function.

CCA is a standard statistical technique for finding linear projections of two random vectors that maximally correlated.

Both CCA and KCCA are techiques for learning representation is simultaneously the most predictively of, and the most predictable by, the other.

An appealing property of CCA for prediction tasks is that, if there is noise in either view that is uncorrelated with the other view, the learned representations should not contain the noise in the uncorrelated dimensions.
